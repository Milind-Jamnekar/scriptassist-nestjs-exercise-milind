# 🛠️ Initial Setup Fixes

- The project did not start successfully after cloning, so I first debugged and fixed critical setup issues to get the application running.
- The codebase was not formatted, which caused unnecessary style changes in commits and made it harder to review actual fixes.
- To ensure a clean baseline, I ran code formatting across the entire project. This keeps further commits focused only on meaningful changes.
